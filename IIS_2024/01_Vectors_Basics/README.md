# Vector Basics

## Dimension
The dimension of a vector is the number of elements that it contains.

## Magnitude
The magnitude of a vector is a non-negative number that represents the vector's size or length. You refer it as the norm  of a vector and can be denoted as ||v|| or |v|.

### Euclidean Norm
To calculate the magnitude of a vector you can use the Euclidean Norm:
$$
||v||_2 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + ... + x_n^2}
$$

## Unit vector
A unit vector is a vector who magnitude is 1.

## Direction
The direction specifies the line along which the vector points.

## Dot product (Scalar product)
The dot product of two vectors, *u* and *v* is a number given by:

$$
u \cdot v = ||u|| \cdot ||v|| \cdot cos(θ)
$$

θ is the angle between the two vectors.
> One of the most important and widely used operations because it measures the similarity between two vectors.

## Orthogonal vectors
Orthogonal vectors are those who their dot product is zero, meaning that the're at a 90 degree to each other.

## Dense vector
A vector is considered dense if most of it's elements are non-zero
